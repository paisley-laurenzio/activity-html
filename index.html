    <p>iPhone 5s is purposefully imagined. Meticulously considered. Precision crafted. It's not just a product of what's technologically possible. But what's technologically useful. It's not hust what's next. But what should ne next.</p>

    <h2>The Most Advanced Technology</h2>
    
    <img src="images/iphonetechnology.jpg" alt="iphone camera">
    
    <p>iPhone 5 set a precedent, with an amazing amount of technology in a remarkably thin, light design. iPhone 5s builds on that achievment with Touch ID (a fingerprint identity sensor). An A7 chip with 64-bit architecture. An even more impressive iSight camera, and ultrafast LTE wireless.</p>

    <h2>iOS 7 Designed to Complement iPhone 5S Beautifully</h2>
    
    <img src="images/iphoneiosdesign.jpg" alt="iphone in hand">
    
    <p>iPhone 5s is the first 64-bit smartphone in the <strong>world</strong>. And iOS 7 was designed with that in mind, built specifically for 64-bit architecture. Which makes iOS 7 just as advanced as the iPhone it's on.</p>
